> Goal was to build a simple contact list
The "home" view shows a list of all of the users in the database.
When I click on any of the users, I'm routed to a view with that user's info.
There is a back button to take me back to the home (list) view.
The URL should reflects the current resource I'm viewing.
All of my data should is stored on Parse.com
